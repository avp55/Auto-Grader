# Auto-Grader

Two part project that leveraged newly acquired data-structure knowledge as well as a more thorough introduction to the C language (CS5002, Spring 2018)
#### Part One
* Ability to create an unlimited amount of Doubly-Linked Lists
  * Program ingested a text file containing how many Doubly Linked Lists were to be created
    * Each Doubly Linked List was required to support the following operations
      * Printing
      * Reverse Printing
      * Searching
      * Adding to Head
      * Adding to Tail
      * Deleting an item
      
#### Part Two
* Given a supplied "correct" program, and text based test case files, it would automatically grade another provided program
  * Each Test-Case file would contain a number of the specified operations above
  * The unknown program's output would be compared against the known good program
  * The result would be outputted as a separate text file, containing an ID Number and Grade
